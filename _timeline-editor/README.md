# Editing the "Off the Highway" project in Timeline Editor #

The "Off the Highway" project is set up for editing and updating content in Timeline Editor. You can add (or delete) stories, rearrange them, and make edits as needed. It's also possible duplicate the entire project for (relatively) painless translation.


## Logging in ##

You can log into this project by visiting this URL:
http://tools.voanews.com/utilities/timeline-editor/?timeline=58182

Enter the password: english
Click the "Edit" button

Let me know if you'll need to access the editor remotely (e.g. teleworking). There's an additional login screen for that.





## The interface ##

The content in timeline editor is broken up into slides, that appear down the left side of editor. Each video profile or story has its own slide. 

You can click on a slide to edit it. If you edit any text fields, be sure to click the "Update" button on the right.

The first three slides are currently being used for project-wide info like: titles, labels and project descriptions:

Slide 0: Has the project title and main introduction. This is also where you edit some of the labels and taglines or replace the banner image on the landing page.

Slide 1: Has the 'About the project' info that appears in the footer on story pages.

Slide 2: Has the project credits.

The rest of the slides are a mix of video profile posts and story posts.




## Adding a new story (Creating a new slide) ##



To add a new video profile or story:

Click on the "+ Slide" button on the left.
Enter the title for the story.
Click on the "HTML" tab.
Paste the text of the story into the editor. (If you don't click the HTML tab, sometimes you'll copy random fonts and formatting from whatever text editor you were using e.g. Microsoft Word.)
Type "video" or "story" in the "series" text field on the right.
Click the "Update" button.
Fill in the related text fields for the video or story
Click the "Update" button to save your work.

The editor will display different fields that you'll need to fill in depending on whether it's a video profile (e.g. a quotation and YouTube link) or a story (a banner image).
